# vim-openai

wip

```
# Usage
# - Write spec as text
# - Select text
# - Run `:terminal ./run.sh` to get results in a new terminal window will appear with the generated code
#   - :'<,'>terminal ./run.sh
# - Run `:!./run.py` to replace selection with output
#   - :'<,'>!./run.py
```

```
# Ideas:
# - Use it as a Vim plugin
#   - separate callable files/modes for the actions
#   - vim plugin (commands / keys to call, auto-extract current filetype and pass it as an arg)
#   - better name for the command
#   - add to my dotfiles or a separate repo (maybe the vim plugin could pull it?)
# - Add tests
```
